# My Random Password Generator 

## Description
Welcome to my random password generator. This let's you create a function, based on the criteria you choose. 
It is written with JavaScript and it made me learn, how to properly implement functions in JavaScript and create a logical structure, starting with variables, over functions,
to the output!

Here is a link to the the password generator: (Password Generator)

## Usage
The usage is very easy! Click the "Generate Password" Button and choose your password length between 8-128. Of course you can also try out what happens, if you enter a number
outside of the given spectrum.

Next, you choose your four options, that you want in your password, make sure to choose at least one of the following options: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters.

After that is done, you can enjoy your newly created, very safe, random password!
