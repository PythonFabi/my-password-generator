# My Random Password Generator 

## Description
Welcome to my random password generator. This let's you create a function, based on the criteria you choose. 
It is written with JavaScript and it made me learn, how to properly implement functions in JavaScript and create a logical structure, starting with variables, over functions,
to the output!

Here is a link to the the password generator: (Password Generator)

## Usage

Next, you choose your four options, that you want in your password, make sure to choose at least one of the following options: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters.
